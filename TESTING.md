# Testing

<a href="README.md">Main README file</a>

I used <a href="https://validator.w3.org/"> Markup Validation Service</a>,  <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">CSS Validation Service</a> and <a href="https://jshint.com/">JSHint</a> to check both HTML, CSS and Javascript using the direct input function of both services. CSS and Javascript came back with no issues flagged. However, Markup Validation Service came back with two warnings in my HTML code. These warnings indicated that there was use of unnessary Javascript in lines 17 and 18. After some investigation according to the EmailJS website both scripts are required in order to connect my form to EmailJS services, so I have left them in the code.
