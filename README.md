# Ram Cycle Team Website

  

<a  href= "https://rvn-r.github.io/milestone-2-cyclingclub/"  >View the live project here..</a>

  

This is the main page for a small cycle team based in Wandsworth, South West London. It is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices and have interactive elements to help meet the client's key goals. The website features an "About Us" section, "Club Ride" section and finally a "Sign Up" section which includes a form to allow visitors to express interest in joining the club.

  

The primary goal of the website is to provide visitors with information regarding the club and to attract new members.

## Design

  

### Colour Scheme

  

The client requested that the colour palette of the website showed a connection to cycling teams past and present. Based on my research, it is clear that cycling teams adopt bright and bold colour schemes, enabling them to stand out in the peloton. The colour palette would also help cement the contemporary feel wanted by the client.  I therefore chose to take inspiration from a current popular cycling team <a  href ="https://bahraincyclingteam.com/">Team Bahrain</a>. I used a website called <a  href="https://coolors.co/">Coolors</a> to experiment with different colours and settled on the list below:

  

* #0ad6ff - Vivid Sky Blue

* #b00404 - Rufous

* #f79800 - Orange Peel

* #f1e900 - Titanium Yellow

* #130a02 - Smoky Black

  

### Typography

  

Lato is the font chosen for use across the site, with Sans Serif as the back up font in case there are any issues importing into the site correctly from Google Fonts. Lato was also used in the creation of the club's logo in photoshop. I considered Roboto but I felt the movement in Lato font would better reflect the client's brand connotations and ethos.

## Features

  

The page consists of three sections. Featured at the top of the page is a navigation bar that runs across it's width. This navigation bar is sticky, meaning when those visiting scroll down the page, the navigation bar remains at the top. Just below the navigation bar is a large banner running the width of the page. Centered within the banner is the club's logo along with a hero image used as the banner's background. The colours used in the navigation bar match those used in the club's logo. You will notice in the club's logo the name and club's date of establishment is housed within the blue banners. To ensure continuity I've used the same Vivid Sky Blue for the navigation bars main font colour. To make it clear to the visitor that their mouse is over a navigational link I've used the colour Rufous as a hover effect to change the font colour. Rufous can be found in the clubs logo, another example of continuity.  The navigation bar features navigational links to "About Us", "Club Rides" and "Join the Crew" sections. At the bottom of the page is a footer with social media icons linking to the club's social media accounts. The footer echoes those colours used for the navigation bar, ensuring a coherent design approach.

  

### <i>About Us</i>

  

The "About Us" section consists of four paragraphs explaining the club's history, benefits, activities and goals for the future. In order to better deliver the key information to those reading this section, I have used two large hero images that share the club's image of community.

  

So that the page is easier to digest on remote devices, the hero images have been disabled on smaller screen sizes. The image would take up valuable screen space and not provide any additional benefit.

  

### <i>Club Ride</i>

  

The "Club Ride" section features a large map of South West London in the centre. Below the map are two call to action buttons labelled "Saturday Ride" and "Lunch Time Ride". To keep a coherent design philosophy running through the site the buttons and the navigation bar have the same colour palette. The button's colour palette inverts once a mouse runs over it. Once clicked the map displays the relevant route. In addition a new section appears with key information relating to the ride. This includes meeting point, ending point and a combined distance of the whole route in kilometres .

  

### <i>Join the Crew</i>

  

The "Join the Crew" section adopts a simple approach to the previous section. This sections main focus is an interactive form, that allows those visiting the site to express interest in joining the club. Once the name and email fields are completed they also have the opportunity to fill out a small text area detailing why they want to join the club. This attribute will be invaluable to the club's admin team, once enquiries start to increase. Once submitted, the form gets emailed to the club admin's email address. The club will then respond to all enquiries with an information pack detailing the next "New Members Ride". Once submitted a modal will appear confirming to the visitor that their enquiry has been submitted correctly. The submit button on the form incorporates the same colour palette used in previous call to action buttons on the site, to show uniformity.

  

## Existing Features

  

*  <i>Header Navigation Bar</i> - Bar is fixed meaning that no matter how far the visitor scolls down the page the bar appears in the same position on the screen. This allows the user to easily navigate across the site.

*  <i>Remote View Navigation Bar</i> - In remote screen sizes a full size navigation bar would get overbearing and take up much needed screen space. Remote view will allow visitors to either scroll up and down the page to find the relevant sections, or toggle the remote view navigation bar to better navigate.

*  <i>Footer Social Icons</i> - Exist at the bottom of the page and allow the visitor to access the club's social media platforms.

*  <i>Call to Action Buttons</i> - Exist in the "Club Ride", and "Join the Crew" sections of the site. Allows the visitor to quickly access key information and communicate with the club's admin team.

*  <i>About Us</i> - Allows the visitor to understand the club's history, values and what they represent to the local community.

*  <i>Map and Route Directions</i> - Incorporating Google Maps Javascript and Directions API this feature informs those visiting the site the location of the club's rides together with the distance covered.

*  <i>Form</i> - This interactive feature is linked to the club admin's Gmail using EmailJS. This feature allows the interested visitor to express interest in joining the club, and allows the club to effectively manage and increase it's membership.

*  <i>Modal</i> - Notifies the visitor that their enquiry has been successful, and when to expect a response.

  

## Features Left to Implement

  

*  <i>GDPR Checkbox</i> - Allows the visitor to approve the use of their email address to inform them of future actions. Also ensures that the cycling club complies with EU data protection law.

*  <i>Gallery</i> - As the cycling group's membership grows over time they may choose to include a member's gallery where photos of Club Rides, or local community events they have organised, can be shared. This would encourage a feeling of community. 

*  <i>Club Store</i> - As the cycling group grows a store section to the page could be added, offering cycling jerseys, caps and other merchandise. This could increase the club's revenue and profile to the wider cycling community. 

*  <i>Processing Payments</i> - When the store is implemented  a payment processing API will be required in order to process payments on the site. 

*  <i>Incorporating Longitude and Latitude</i> - Currently, strings have been used in order to communicate the cycling routes origin, destination and waypoints to Googles DirectionsRenderer and DirectionsService objects. In addition, a polyfill script featured at the top of the index.html page has been used to help make this connection. Fortunately Google has an extensive library of locations across London pre-mapped. This allows for strings to be used in order to render these locations on the map. However, in the future I need to experiment with incorporating longitude and latitude instead of strings. This will allow the routes to be more accurate, and less reliant upon Google's location library.

*  <i> Add New Cycling Routes Without Rewriting Function</i> - The main Javascript function showRoute that has been used to render the cycling routes onto a map work well. However, should the club want to add more routes they would have a challenge in doing so without the help of someone who understood Javascript. This is due to the fact that I wrapped up the logic within the main function. Google's directionsRenderer and directionsService objects require a route's origin, destination and waypoint in order to render a route on a map. In a bid to simplify the code I created a variable called ROUTES, that contained an array with list of values called routeName and routeDetails. Once called, the showRoute function would look for these values in the array,  and then use the information inside routeDetails to feed origin, destination and waypoint. This information would go back to Google's directionsRenderer and directionsService and render the route on the map. Although this has simplified the process of adding additional routes, some experience in coding  would still be necessary in order to add a call to action button for the new route. In future, a different approach similar to the ROUTES variable should be taken for creating new call to action button for the new route. More experience in Javascript is needed before I am able to execute this future feature. However the existing code more than meets the client's requirements
