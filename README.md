# Ram Cycle Team Website

<a href= "https://rvn-r.github.io/milestone-2-cyclingclub/" >View the live project here..</a>

This is the main page for a small cycle team based in Wandsworth South West London. It is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices and have interactive elements to help meet the clients key goals. The website features an About Us section, Club Rides section and finally a Sign Up section with a form so visitors can express interest in joining the club. 

The primary goal of the website is to inform those visiting about the club and attract new memebers to the club to help it grow.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

The client requested that the colour palette of the website had a connection to cycling teams past and present. From my research its clear that cycling teams adopt bright and bold colour schemes, enabling them to stand out in the peloton. The client also wanted the website to have a contempory feel and the colour palette should reflect that. I therefore chose to take inspiration from a current popular cycling team <a href ="https://bahraincyclingteam.com/">Team Bahrain</a>. I used a website called <a href="https://coolors.co/">Coolors</a> to experiment with different colours and settled on the list below: 

* #0ad6ff - Vivid Sky Blue 
* #b00404 - Rufous 
* #f79800 - Orange Peel
* #f1e900 - Titanium Yellow
* #130a02 - Smoky Black

###  Typography 

Lato is the font chosen for use across the site, with Sans Serif as the back up font in case there are any issues importing into the site correcly from Google Fonts. Lato was also used in the creation of the clubs logo in photoshop. I considered Roboto but I felt the movement in Lato font would better reflect the clients brand connotations and ethos.

# Features

The page consists of three sections, at the top of the page is a navigation bar that runs the width of the page. This navigation bar is sticky meaning when those visitng scoll down the page the navigation remains in the same position. Just below the navigation bar is a large banner runnig the width of the page. Centered within the banner is the clubs logo along with a hero image used as the banners background. The colours used in the Navigation Bar match those used in the clubs logo. You'll notice in the clubs logo the name and clubs date of establishment is housed within blue banners. Taking insperiaton of this we have used Vivid Sky Blue for the navigation bars main font colour and Smoky Black as the background colour. To inform the visitor that there mouse is over a navigation link I used the colour Rufous as a hover effect to change the font colour. The navigation bar features navigational links to About Us, Club Rides and Join the Crew. At the bottom of the page is a footer with social media icons linking to the clubs soical media accounts. The fotter eachoes those colours used for the navigation bar, ensuring a coherent design approach. 

### <i>About Us</i>

The About Us section consists of one large paragraph explaining the clubs history, benefits, activites and goals for the future. In order to better deliver the key information to those reading this section, I have used one large hero image that shares the  the clubs connotations that of group paticipation. 

To make the page easier to digest on remote devices the hero image isn't visable on smaller screen sizes. The image would take up valuable screen space and not provide any additonal benifit. 

### <i>Club Ride</i>

The Club Ride section has a simple layout in order to maximise attention from those viewing it. In its center is a large map of south west london. Just below the map are two call to action buttons labelled Saturday Ride and Lunch Time Ride. The colours of these buttons mirror that used in the clubs logo and pages navigation bar. The buttons colour pallette inverts once a mouse runs over it. Once clicked the map displays the relevant route. In addition a new section appears with key information on the ride. This includes meeting point, ending point and a total distance in KM of the whole route. 

### <i>Join the Crew</i>

Join the Crew section adopts the simple approach used in the previous section. The sections main focus is an interactive form, that allows those visiting the site to express interest in joining the club. Once they fill out the name, email sections they also have the oppertuntiy to fill out a small text area detailing why they want to join the club. This attribute will be invaluable to sales admin, once enquiries start to increase. Once submitted the form gets emails to a club admin email address. The Club will then respond to all enquires with an information pack detaling the next "New Memebers Ride". The submit button on the form incorporates the same colour palette used in previous call to action buttons on the site.
