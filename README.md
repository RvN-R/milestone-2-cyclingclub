## Design

### Colour Scheme

The client requested that the colour palette of the website had a connection to cycling teams past and present. From my research its clear that cycling teams adopt bright and bold colour schemes, enabling them to stand out in the peloton. The client also wanted the website to have a contempory feel and the colour palette should reflect that. I therefore chose to take inspiration from a current popular cycling team <a href ="https://bahraincyclingteam.com/">Team Bahrain</a>. I used a website called <a href="https://coolors.co/">Coolors</a> to experiment with different colours and settled on the list below: 

* #0ad6ff
* #b00404
* #f79800
* #f1e900
* #130a02

###  Typography 

Lato is the font chosen for use across the site, with Sans Serif as the back up font in case there are any issues importing into the site correcly from Google Fonts. Lato was also used in the creation of the clubs logo in photoshop. I considered Roboto but I felt the movement in Lato font would better reflect the clients brand connotations and ethos.
